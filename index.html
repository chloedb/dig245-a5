  <h2>My test</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Find a comedy movie</li>
    <li>Add the movie to your list</li>
    <li>Find the movie in your list and play it</li>
    <li>Go to the fifty minute mark</li>
    <li>Start the movie from the beginning from the homepage</li>
  </ol>

    <h2>Discussion</h2>
    <p>
      The user completed each task in a matter of seconds as an everyday Netflix user.
      She did not like the desktop layout as much as on the TV because some options were missing on the desktop version.
      The only task she could not do easily was the last task to restart the movie from the beginning.
      Netflix does not have a restart option, so she had to go into the movie itself and start it over by hand.
      Her spoken thoughts were fluid and connected to the task at hand. For example, when she found a comedy movie,
      her commentary was "I am going to movies, and I'm clicking genre." This makes me believe Netflix is set up well
      for specifics in regards to the test's tasks.

      <li>"I am scrolling through the movie on the bar until the minutes say 50."</li>
        <img src="photos/50minutes.png" width="500" height="300">
      <li>"Clicking return to browse." At first, I was not clear in my instructions that she could only replay from the home screen. She had to go into the movie itself and start over. There was no button to access restart from the homescreen.</li>
